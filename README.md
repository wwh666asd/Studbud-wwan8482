The main function of Studbud is to help people who have poor ability to remember words to manage their learning time. I have also added timers and music players to make the site more attractive to users.

## Website adaptation instructions
This website uses <font size=4>**1325×850**</font> size on the laptod, and the mobile phone uses the screen size of iPhone 12 Pro (<font size=4>**390×844**</font>), so there may be some shortcomings in different devices.
