## Charity introduction
The main function of Studbud is to help people who have poor ability to remember words to manage their learning time. I have also added timers and music players to make the site more attractive to users.


## Website adaptation instructions
This website uses <font size=4>**1325×850**</font> size on the laptod, and the mobile phone uses the screen size of iPhone 12 Pro (<font size=4>**390×844**</font>), so there may be some shortcomings in different devices.


## Design Principle
>Color and shape


## Design Pattern
>input prompt

>Navigation Tabs


## Iterations

>1.I have deleted some unnecessary buttons, such as user buttons, because I think this is a learning website, so I should highlight the help of the website to learning. for example user profile interface

>2.Color update when clicking on the button: the original color is similar to the navigation bar, but the updated one is more obvious.
